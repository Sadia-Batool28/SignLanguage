 ðŸ¤Ÿ Real-Time Sign Language Recognition System

A mobile application that uses real-time image processing and a trained TensorFlow Lite model to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet gestures using the camera on Android devices. This project helps bridge communication gaps for individuals using sign language.

Description:

This Android application recognizes ASL alphabet gestures, including:

- Alphabets (Aâ€“Z)
- Space
- Delete
- "Nothing" gesture

Built using:
- **Java (Android Studio)**
- **CameraX API**
- **TensorFlow Lite**
- **Firebase** for storage
- **Python** (for model training)

Team Members:

| Name            | Role/Contribution |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Laiba Sultana** | Dataset creation, Splash screen, Training model, Real-time detection |
| **Sadia Batool** | Login, Signup, Password recovery, Firebase integration, Profile page |
| **Atia Zia**     | Home page, Camera integration, ASL Dictionary, Dataset-camera linking |

Objectives:

- Enable real-time gesture recognition via camera.
- Accurately detect ASL characters.
- Support for additional functional gestures like space, delete, and "nothing".
